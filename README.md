# Static Comp Challenge 3

Static Comp Challange 3 was a challenge given to showcase HTML/CSS strengths. It required the ability to take a static image and no additional resources and recreate as close to the originl designer's creation as possible.

This was the most challenging HTML/CSS challenge I have undertaken to date but I feel as if I met the challenge head on and produced a worth recreation.
